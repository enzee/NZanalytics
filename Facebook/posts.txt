Thank you so much for those who have already supported Alex through your messages, sharing and donations. In a little over 3 days we've managed to raised over Â£40000 and we are so close to the final goal. I am amazed at the collaborative power of social media! More importantly I'm amazed by the spirit of the people to come together for the good of a one-of-a-kind person. Love x
Please support my brother in his time of need (thanks in advance) x
YESSSS!
Brandon Byran feels like yesterday!
Still applies! I'm going to keep it 100% real 2016 was a rollercoaster of a year

Lost grandad after a battle with dementia and other complications. He was the most hard working and humble man I know and without him I wouldn't be where I am today. It amazed me to see the levels of respect people had for him. I hope to be able to hold a candle to his legacy.

It was also a year in which a close childhood friend was diagnosed w/ brain cancer. His approach to the whole situation honestly inspires me and I pray for his recovery. Through him I'm learning to appreciate life and being more open in showing love to people while you can. 

I can't say 2016 was all gloom since it's the year I became an uncle to my beautiful niece and nephew. I've never been more proud of my brother and they're growing up to be healthy happy babies. I could speak of other achievements but honestly nothing compares to this.

I met some amazing people, had fun times and learned many lessons last year. This year, as always, I look forward to continue building the best version of myself. If you managed to get this far I wish you a fantastic 2017! 

Peace and Love x
