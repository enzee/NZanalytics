As long as your have the means to be self-sufficient and survive maybe we can all just do what we really want to do. Life's way too short
Really stuck w/ me and made me question a lot of things. What is the notion of a "proper" job anyway. Stability is an illusion
Today at work somebody who used to be a professional tennis player said they quit it to get a  "proper" job
@Pets93 amen!

@Elliott8694 ofc 😂😂 I think that's only the 2nd Kenneth kill of 2016. It's been a slow year!
One of those rare times in life where I know exactly what I want. Now I have clarity I just gotta step up, be a man and take it
@SilentDo0m and add some cool down to Diddy's dtilt thanks Sakurai 👌
#AmazonGo is disruption at it's prime (pardon the pun)

VW just announced a new company #MOAI
#disrupt is gonna be 👌
Was impressed with the general difficulty of the game compared to previous generations. Looking forward to what endgame has to offer
Only 2 major gripes with Sun/moon:
1. New chaining method sucks
2. Very dialogue/ cutscene intensive
The moment when you're listening to Gambino mixtapes on youtube and you realise the new album drops tomorrow! :)

This year I learned there are sick bastards out there who drink English tea w/ no milk
@SilentDo0m brexit zinoto 😂😂

@SilentDo0m 10000%
Nice to see some original content in the grime scebe
I'm essentially bantering myself here. Nobody made me buy them. Christmas is on hold temporarily 😭
Sharper than the Lucadris fade in the pic every barbershop uses
